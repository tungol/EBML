known deviations from spec:

- I parse '%children;' as three tokens: '%', 'children', ';'. This means that whitespace (and comments) are allowed in there. The spec regards '%children;' as a single token, with no allowed whitespace. This shouldn't be a big deal.

- the BNF form for the date definitions doesn't seem to match with the text: I went with the text.

- both the text and the BNF agree the UintRanges can't be open ended, but the EDTD for matroska contains an element which uses it as open ended:
	BlockAddID := ee uint [ range:1..; ]
I have to allow UintRanges to be open-ended in order to parse this. The matroska documentation confirms the open-ended range. I'm interpreting it like the level range BNF. There are several other elements in the matroska EDTD that have the same open uint range as well.

comment on the BNF for types defs says can only be def and range, examples in the text use size and range. Matroska DTD only uses range.

TrackUID is uint in the matroska DTD, should be binary?

'a3' element, appears in a file. Child of Cluster containers, seem to be a newer version of the block structure? Lots of them, and they're big.
